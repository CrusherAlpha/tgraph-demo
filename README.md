# tgraph-demo
A demo for [tgraph](https://github.com/CrusherAlpha/tgraph).

My graduation design demo for master degree.

Graph visualization is adopted from [JavaFX SmartGraph library](https://github.com/brunomnsilva/JavaFXSmartGraph) written by [Bruno Silva](https://github.com/brunomnsilva) and [Java Graph Algorithms Visualizer](https://github.com/rayjasson98/Java-Graph-Algorithms-Visualizer) written by [Ray Jasson](https://github.com/rayjasson98).

# NOTE
Code style of this demo project is terrible, full of shit, but it works as expect fortunately, so do not touch it...
